Me and my team of 4 developed this website in 2 days in order to solve the following problem statement assigned to us: 

> Develop a website for Teacher-Student management during online classes.

This was for the concluding project of a camp organized by IEEE during April 2021. 15 teams were given different problem statements to solve using project based learning(the main topic of discussion in the 11 day camp), and we had a day and a half to create a unique solution.

This website earned us first place among all the groups.
